# Movie Tracker

This is a simple Python project I made to keep track of the movies I’ve watched (or want to watch).

It runs in the terminal and lets you add, edit, delete, and search for movies. You can also group movies by genre, view only the ones you haven’t watched, and get some top-rated recommendations.

The data is saved in a plain `.txt` file so it stays even after you close the program.

### Features:
- Add new movies (name, director, genre, watched or not, rating)
- Edit or delete existing movies
- Search by name, director, or genre
- Show movies you haven’t watched yet
- Group movies by genre
- Recommend movies with high ratings (8+)
- Save and load from a text file

### Tools Used:
- Python (no libraries)
- File reading/writing
- Lists, dictionaries, and basic logic

### How to run:
Just make sure you have Python installed, then run:

```bash
python movie-tracker-project.py
